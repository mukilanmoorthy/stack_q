# ðŸŽ¨ Theme & Toast Notifications

Stackquae uses modern UI enhancements to create a smooth, responsive, and accessible user experience. Two key parts of this are:

- ðŸŒ— Light/Dark Theme toggle  
- ðŸ”” Toast notifications & tooltips

## ðŸŒ— Theme Support with `next-themes`

We use [`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) to allow users to switch between **light** and **dark** mode.

### How it works

In your main app:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="dark" enableSystem>
  {/* App content */}
</ThemeProvider>
